Wheeeeeee!
==========

This is a simple app, written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org),
that displays a green circle in the middle of your browser
window, which you can drag around the window with your mouse.

I wrote it as a fun experiment, just to get a feel for Elm.

Protip: If you say "Wheeeeeee!" while dragging the circle
around very quickly, it makes it more fun.
