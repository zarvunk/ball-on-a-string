Wheeeeeee!
==========

This is a simple app, written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org),
that displays a green circle in the middle of your browser
window, which you can drag around the window with your mouse.

New in version 1.2 is a sort of macro-like feature: Drag the
circle around while holding down the `r` key to record all the
circle movements as you drag it, then press `p` to replay what
you just recording, starting from the circle's new position.

I wrote it as a fun experiment, just to get a feel for Elm.

Protip: If you say "Wheeeeeee!" while dragging the circle
around very quickly, it makes it more fun.
