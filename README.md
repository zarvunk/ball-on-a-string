# A ball on a string

This is a simple web app, written in
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org), that displays a circle which you
can swing around the window with your mouse as though it's
connected by an elastic band. Try it out
[here](https://zarvunk.github.io/ball-on-a-string)!

You can also swing the circle around while holding down the
`r` key to record all the circle's movements, then press `p`
to replay what you just recorded, starting from the circle's
new position.

I wrote it as a fun experiment, just to get a feel for Elm.
