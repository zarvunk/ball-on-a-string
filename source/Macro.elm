{- [^keepThen]: {{{1

Originally this was defined not with `switchWhenSample`
(from Signal.Extra.Extra) but with keepThen (from
Signal.Extra). What we want to do here, after all, is (a)
when the value of `recording` becomes True, start
listening to `actions`, re-emitting anything it sends; (b)
when `recording` becomes False, emit the value Nothing.
`keepWhen` would have done the trick, except it doesn't
emit Nothing again when `recording` becomes False.
`keepThen`, however, does; it ought to fit the bill.
Except that it doesn't work exactly as advertised: There's
an additional difference between it and `keepWhen`, namely
that it *samples* the given Signal (in this case
`actions`) immediately when it switches to it (when
`recording` emits a True) --- in this respect it behaves
like `sampleWhen`. What you get by sampling a Signal is
the most recent value that the Signal has emitted ---
which will of course have been emitted *before* the act of
sampling. Which is to say that switching to `actions`
(upon `recording` giving us a True) and sampling it right
away actually gives us the most recent action emitted
*before* recording was supposed to begin!  That will not
stand!

Why does `keepThen` behave this way? Well, it turns out that
`keepThen` is actually implemented in terms of switch helper, Which,
naturally enough, is also the basis for `switchWhen` and
`switchSample`. Why in terms of the switch helper?  Well, the point of
`keepThen` is that it should re-emit the default value when the
toggle signal emits False; Which is implemented as switching back
to a constant signal whose single never-emitted value is the
default value that you give to `keepThen`. But switch helper will,
depending on one of its parameters that you give it, either sample
each of its Signals whenever it switches to either of them, or not
sample but only listen.  What we want is to only sample from the
constant signal, because otherwise you don't get anything from it,
since it never emits anything. We need more flexibility than
`switchHelper` allows for. So I wrote my own `switchHelper`
function in the module Signal.Extra.Extra for precisely this
purpose.

{- [^reset]: {{{1

Originally I was using not `foldps` but good old `foldp`, with
the fold being a simple List-prepend (`::`). But the problem
with that was that the list we were folding over persisted
over all recording sessions; when the provided Signal of Bool
switched from True to False and then back to True, the `foldp`
would keep prepending to the same list as before. What was
needed was a way to "reset" the folded-over list when
`recording` emits a False, so that the list always
corresponded to the currently-recording macro, rather than a
cumulative list of everything we've ever recorded. It became
clear that the only way to do this was to have the fold
maintain an extra bit of state, which would tell it whether
the incoming action was the next action in the current macro
or the first action in a new macro. But it would have been
silly for this state to be passed downstream, only to be
discarded; it's distinct from what needs to be passed onward
and entirely internal to the fold-----a perfect chance for
`foldps` to shine!

Hopefully the code plus its interleaved comments are clear
enough that you can see how this mechanism works.
