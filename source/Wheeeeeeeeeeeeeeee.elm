-- hoverable is intended to do much the same thing as
-- Graphics.Input.hoverable, except it takes a Form rather than an
-- Element. It detects whether the given Coordinates are within the
-- boundaries of the given Form (which is assumed to be a
-- circle[^type]), and sends this information (True or False) to the
-- given Address[^message]. Naturally you'll want to map it over a Signal or
-- two and bind the result to a port.

{- [^message]: {{{1
   Graphics.Input.hoverable takes, instead of an Address, a function
   from a Bool to a Message, --- which fulfills the same purpose and
   amounts to the same thing, since a Message (if I understand it
   right) is just a wrapper for the act of sending a thing to some
   address (that is, the address and thing you passed in to
   Signal.message). But in what way are Messages better? The
   documentation suggests that their advantage is that they're an
   alternative to Tasks, only for sending to Addresses, --- which
   means you don't need a port, I guess? A port being what allows
   you to "execute arbitrary Tasks" (I quote the docs for Message
   from memory), which maybe you don't always want. But then how do
   you execute / send a Message? That's not clear to me. Graphics.Input,
   for its part, implements hoverable (and thus this whole Message
   business) via Native.Graphics.Input, which is to say via Javascript,
   using Elm's Javascript-facing API. So maybe there is no way to
   actually send / execute Messages in Elm itself. }}}1
